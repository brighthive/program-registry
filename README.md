# program-registry
A comprehensive directory of youth programs and services â€“ openly available and machine readable.

# Design and Documentation
The API spec can be publicly viewed [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/BrightHive/program-registry) and is hosted [here](https://docs.brighthive.io/v1.0/reference#organization).

The folder [.openapi](/openapi) was generated automatically by SwaggerHub. We have set up [`Github Sync`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/integrations/github-sync) for the API spec on Swaggerhub. It promises to automatically update the spec on Github with changes done in SwaggerrHub. The API design and documentation process, therefore, is that all stakeholders collaborate on SwaggerHub and the update is synced on Github upon save.

> NB

We noted however that this integration is still buggy (It doesn't sync with Github on save). The integration works well for setting up this workflow for a new repo. So we activated [`Github Push`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/integrations/github-push) for the syncing. The spec file is at [.openapi/swagger.yaml](.openapi/swagger.yaml).

### To adopt this workflow

For a similar workflow, you'll find that the docs in [`Github Push`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/integrations/github-push) and [`Github Sync`](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/integrations/github-sync) are quite straight forward.

Be sure to set:
- a separate branch other that the main ones (In our case we chose *SWAGGERHUB*)
- swagger output folder as `.openapi` and 
- swagger file as `swagger.yaml`

# Development Setup
## Steps
### Prerequisites
- Python3
- pip
- Postgres (with a database 'registry' created)

### Run the following commands

Install required python packages and export environment variables by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export APP_SETTINGS="development"
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/registry
```

If it is your first time, create the database and run migrations by running:
```bash
python3 manage.py db init
python3 manage.py db migrate
python3 manage.py db upgrade
```

To seed-in data run:

```bash
python3 manage.py seed_data
```

Now start the server:
```bash
python3 app.py
```


The API is now accessible from: `0.0.0.0:5000/api` and the API spec at: `0.0.0.0:5000/api/ui/`

> Endpoints

So the urls are:
`/api` - as the main API endpoint
`/api/ui/` - as the API SPEC url endpoint

# Testing
Run `python3 manage.py test` after following the Development Setup above.


# Docker workflow
## Steps
### Prerequisites
- docker (Download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and choose `Get Docker` for either the desktop version or server version)

### Run the following command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

# Deployment
This project is using `Heroku Container Registry` for ~~automatic~~ deployments of master and develop branches. It is part of the CI/CD pipeline as detailed in [heroku.sh](/heroku.sh).

Before running `sh heroku.sh`:

Run `export HEROKU_DATASTORE_URI=<>` with the `<>` replaced by the URI (obtained by running either `heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE --app programs-registry-dev` for `develop` branch or `heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE --app programs-registry` for `master` branch.)

> Please note

The Postgres Add-on does not have automatic reset for each deployment so the developers will need to reset the DB whenever we have changes to the models. To do this run either `heroku pg:reset DATABASE --app programs-registry-dev` for `develop` branch or `heroku pg:reset DATABASE --app programs-registry` for `master` branch.

The DB URI may also change from time to time so the developers may need rotate the Database URI by running `heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE --app programs-registry-dev` for `develop` branch or `heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE --app programs-registry` for `master` branch.

If you prefer using the Web UI, log into heroku with the Brighthive engineering email then click [here](data.heroku.com). Select the Datastore associated with the app in question (either programs-registry or programs-registry-dev, in this case), then click on Settings. The `Reset Database` button can be seen on this page. Clicking on the `View Credentials` button on that page will reveal the **URI** alluded to earlier.
